# CS598-DL4H

This is the public repository of Shuhong Zheng's (szheng36) DL4H course project.

The environment can be installed according to the instructions in https://github.com/MembrAI/MIU-VL, or it can be installed by
```bash
cd MIU-VL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


The MIU-VL directory is the main directory for the experiments. 

Running the following scripts generates the medical prompts automatically using the MLM strategy:
```bash
cd MIU-VL
bash RUN/autoprompt/make_auto_mlm.sh
```

Running the following scripts start the evaluation on the detection task for the prompts generated by the MLM strategy:
```bash
cd MIU-VL
bash RUN/polyp_test/zero_shot_lama.sh
```

Running the following scripts generates the medical prompts automatically using the hybrid strategy:
```bash
cd MIU-VL
bash RUN/autoprompt/make_auto_mlm.sh
```

Running the following scripts start the evaluation on the detection task for the prompts generated by the hybrid strategy:
```bash
cd MIU-VL
bash RUN/polyp_test/zero_shot_lama.sh
```

Or we can use the test_scripts.sh in the ./MIU-VL folder, but remember to change the jsonFile argument in the script to be the corresponding generated prompt file:
```bash
cd MIU-VL
bash test_scripts.sh
```
